# Hawkeye HPC Requirements
# Optimized for HPC GPU clusters (V100, A100)
# Install: pip install -r requirements-hpc.txt

# Include VLM requirements (includes DL and base)
-r requirements-vlm.txt

# HPC Specific Optimizations
ninja>=1.11.0          # For faster compilation

# Distributed Training
deepspeed>=0.12.0      # DeepSpeed for large model training

# NVIDIA Tools (usually pre-installed on HPC)
# nvidia-ml-py>=12.0.0

# Profiling
py-spy>=0.3.0          # Performance profiling
memory_profiler>=0.61.0

# Note: On HPC, prefer conda for PyTorch with optimized CUDA
# conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
